Assignment
# modules random to generate to coordinate for geometry rectangles
# for x axis and y axis total 4 numbers
# ask user to key in the point as integer
# all object will store as list []

Development steps
# writing down the objects on paper
# writing a class for each object
# writing methods for each class
# calling the classes and their methods
